# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `fineo`
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive financial analysis platform powered by AI`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private as needed
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the new GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fineo.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fineo`
2. You should see all the project files uploaded
3. The README.md should display the project information

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create the repository directly:

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create fineo --public --description "A comprehensive financial analysis platform powered by AI"

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Features to Enable

After uploading, consider enabling these GitHub features:

1. **Issues**: For bug tracking and feature requests
2. **Wiki**: For additional documentation
3. **Discussions**: For community interaction
4. **Actions**: For CI/CD (optional)
5. **Security**: Enable Dependabot for dependency updates

## Environment Variables Setup

Remember to:
1. Never commit the actual `.env` file with real credentials
2. Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive environment variables in Actions
3. Update the `.env.example` file when adding new environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Add a LICENSE file if needed
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Configure GitHub Pages if you want to host documentation
4. Add contributors and collaborators as needed
